# Portfolio Project 1 – Regression – Time Series Prediction

## Sales Prediction

### General Overview
The aim of the project is to predict the future sale of goods in the large grocery store net from Ecuador, the raw data were taken from Kaggle. The business goal for such a project is rather obvious – the proper forecast can  optimise purchases, decrease the cost of caring warehouse, reduce wastes and avoid stockouts. Simple speaking: to reduce costs and enlarge incomes – at the end this is that is all about. 

### Data Used
I used the public available data sets available on Kaggle platform:
##### *Corporación Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting*
Which was one of the Kaggle competition.

### Project content


The original project is very interesting but it is also complicated. In fact it is too complicated for purpose of the portfolio projects, which should be relative simple and easy to follow in a relatively short time. 
The project contains two notebooks:

That is why I decided to simplify it: I took into account only sales amount aggregated through all stores and I analysed only one index. This is enough to present the method without unnecessary complication. 
Sales prediction for 15 days was made using 2.5 years historic data.
Two different algorithms were used: one from pure Machine Learning area and second presenting more classical statistical approach. I thought it could be interesting to compare them.  



### Algorithm used

1.	Random Forest algorithm used to Time Series forecasting
2.	ARIMA – statistical method used to Time Series analysis

The notebooks *Random Forest* and *ARIMA* contains them respectively.



### Summary

I used two different method and came up with similar results and model estimation (MSE). The next step is to preform more systematic adjustment of models hyperparameters to improve the results, also other methods can be used.
